# Exercise: Data Types and Operators
## Overview

This exercise is designed to build foundational skills in Python by working with core data types and operators. It focuses on writing simple, correct, and readable Python code to solve practical problems.

## Learning Objectives

In this exercise, we practice:

- Declaring and using variables in Python

- Performing basic arithmetic operations

- Printing outputs to the console

- Working with different data types (integers, floats, strings)

- String manipulation

- Type casting between data types

- Applying appropriate operators to solve real-world problems

## Topics Covered

- Python data types

  - `int`

  - `float`

  - `str`

- Arithmetic operators

  - Addition (`+`)

  - Subtraction (`-`)

  - Multiplication (`*`)

  - Division (`/`)

- String concatenation and formatting

- Type conversion using `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`

## Files

- `.ipynb` file(s) containing the exercise solutions and examples

- `README.md` (this file)

## How to Run
1. ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.

3. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or the VS Code Jupyter extension.

4. Run the cells sequentially.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with the Jupyter extension installed

## Purpose

The goal of this exercise is to strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals, which are essential for data analysis, automation, and further programming work.
